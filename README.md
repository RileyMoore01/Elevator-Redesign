For this project I took a sample photot of a random elevator door pannel. 
From there I looked at the design of the pannel and ways I could improve it.
That turned into a sketch on paper of what I think a better model would be.
Then transitioning that into an interactive GUI using processing.

You are able to find my code for this project in the "src" folder.
